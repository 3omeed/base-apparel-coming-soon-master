## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- - Flexbox
- - CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

this is my first project with javascript code in it, feels very good and responsive
to have a dynamic challenge that, respond to client
I learned more about css flexbox properties and had a good experience about landmarks

### Useful resources

- [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for javascript things to search for such as :
  adding error msg to the input.
  I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [w3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/) -I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
